# My-Webpage

Link for My Webpage : https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vamsikrishna/

1. Firstly i have used 4 `<div>` tags inside the `<body>` tag for the following sections **Profile picture** and **Personal details**, **About me**, **Education**, **Experience**.
2. In the **Profile picture** and **Personal details** section i used `<table>` tag with `<tr>`, `<td>` to insert my picture and my present university details and also used `<a>`, `<img>` tag to insert website link of **IIT Bombay** and **My Picture**.
3. In **About me** section i used paragraph `<p>` tag to write about me and `<a>` tag to insert Website link of **IIT Bombay**.
4. In **Education** section i used `<table>` tag with `<tr>`, `<td>` and `<a>` to fill my education details and their website links.
5. In the **Experience** section i used  `<strong>` tag for my **Internship title** and `<p>` tag to describe about my internship experience.
6. In the **footer** section i used `<a>` tag for Phone number and linkedIn links and also used code for the Phone number and link symbol which i took from google(symbol codes).
7. In the **Main `<Head>`** tag i used `<style>` tag and included some styling like background colours separately for the different sections.
8. In the `<style>` tag i created some classes for adjusting padding and Centering using `padding`, `<margin>` and `text-align: center`.
9. Also i used `text decoration` for links using `a:hover` in the `<style>` tag for all the website links in the Webpage.
10. At last i kept some of my practice content using comments.
